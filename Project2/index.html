		<h2> Player Spotlight: Ichiro Suzuki </h2>
			<img src="assets/ichiro-1.png" class="ichiro1" alt="ichiro1">
			<p class="slide1"> Ichiro Suzuki began his career with the Orix Blue Wave of Nippon in Japan, where <br>he became the first player to ever
				top 200 hits in a single season. His .385 batting <br>average in 1994 was a Pacific League record, and marked the beginning
				of many <br>batting titles to come. The following year, Ichiro lead the Blue Wave to their first <br>Pacific League
				championship in 12 years. <br><br>In 2001 Ichiro joined the Seattle Mariners, becoming the first Japanese-born <br>position
				player to be posted and signed to an MLB club. He quickly aquired a .350 <br>batting average and 56 stolen bases, the first to
				do so since Jackie Robinson in <br>1949. Apart from his unprecedented numbers, Ichiro brought intense media attention<br> to the
				Mariners. Fans from Japan took incredibly expensive baseball tours to watch<br> Ichiro's games. More than 150 Japense reporters
				and photographers were given<br> media access to Safeco Field. <br><br> Ichiro would go on to become one of the most impressive
				All Stars in the MLB. In a 2001 <br>game against the Oakland Athletics, Ichiro made a miraculous throw,
				nailing Terrence <br>Long who was trying to go first-to-third on a single to right field. His "laser beam" throw <br> soon became
				legendary. Throughout his career, Ichiro racked up 3,089 hits in the MLB,<br> and 1,278 in Japan, for a total of 4,367. He is
				second only to Pete Rose, who still holds <br>the record for most career hits, with 4,683.<br><br> Ichiro's last two games in the MLB
				were March 20th, 2019(opening day) and the <br>following day at the Tokyo Dome in Japan. At 45 years old, he was the second oldest<br> position
				player to start for a team on its opening day. He will very likely be the first <br>player to be inducted into the halls of fame in both Japan
				and the United States.</p>
